            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        </br>
            <p>
                Note that you'll sometimes see this agreement referred to as a Terms of Use, User Agreement or Terms of Service agreement. These terms are interchangeable and refer to the same type of agreement.            </p>
        </br>
            <p>
                The purpose of a Terms and Conditions agreement is to prevent misunderstandings between the business owner (you), and the consumer. The agreement helps you:            </p> 
        </br>
                <ul> 
                    <li> Protect your intellectual property </li>
                    <li> Avoid website abuse </li>
                    <li>  Define the limits of your legal obligations to the consumer</li>
                </ul> 
                
            </p>
        </br>
            <p>
                This agreement forms the basis of an enforceable legal relationship. It tells anyone browsing your website, whether they are a casual visitor or an active client, what their legal responsibilities and rights are.            </p>
        </br>
            <p>It also gives you, as the business owner and service provider, authority over certain undesirable things that a consumer may do on your website. However, let's consider the specific reasons why business owners should always include a Terms and Conditions agreement on their website.</p>
